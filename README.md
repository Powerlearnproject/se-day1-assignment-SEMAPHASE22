Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality
software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and
systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Emergence as a profession: By the early 1980s software engineering had already emerged as a bona fide profession,[2] to stand beside computer science and traditional engineering.
Role of women: Before 1970 men filling the more prestigious and better paying hardware engineering roles often delegated the writing of software to women, and legends such as Grace Hopper or Margaret Hamilton filled many computer programming jobs.
Today, fewer women work in software engineering than in other professions, a situation whose cause is not clearly identified. Many academic and professional organizations consider this situation unbalanced and are trying hard to solve it.
Processes: Processes have become a big part of software engineering. They are hailed for their potential to improve software but sharply criticized for their potential to constrict programmers

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning & Analysis:The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
2.Define Requirement:This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents: a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification, a Use Case document, and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.
3. Design:The design phase is where you put pen to paper—so to speak. The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, and application security measures. This is also where you can flowchart how the software responds to user actions.
4. Development:The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.
5. Testing: Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do. The testing process can also help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues. In some cases, software testing can be done in a simulated environment. Other simpler tests can also be automated.
6. Deployment: During the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user. You can automate this process and schedule your deployment depending on the type. For example, if you are only deploying a feature update, you can do so with a small number of users (canary release).
7. Maintenance: In the maintenance stage, users may find bugs and errors that were missed in the earlier testing phase. These bugs need to be fixed for better user experience and retention. In some cases, these can lead to going back to the first step of the software development life cycle

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software engineer plays the following role: 
Designing and maintaining software systems.
Evaluating and testing new software programs.
Optimizing software for speed and scalability.
Writing and testing code.
Consulting with clients, engineers, security specialists, and other stakeholders.
A Quality assurance engineer: Software quality assurance ensures that the software meets the specified quality standards and requirements. This results in software that is more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly
Project Manager:Software project managers serve as liaisons between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project. They may be responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resources to help complete the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: They provide a central interface for common developer tools, making the software development process much more efficient. Developers can start programming new applications quickly instead of manually integrating and configuring different software. e.g AWS Cloud9
VCS:  helps to  manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications.It also protects the source code from any unintended human error and consequences e.g Bild's Cloud PDM

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses
from your robot or AI assistant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How to make delicious soup is my example of vague prompt, it should rather be; "I want recipe for making a delicious vegetable soup"
